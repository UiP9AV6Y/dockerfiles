# how to use this image

this image provides Unbound, a validating, recursive, and
caching DNS resolver. it is intended to be deployed either
as standalone instance or alongside an authoritative
DNS server such as [Bind][], [PowerDNS][] or [NSD][].

the configuration is slightly opiniated and the majority of
input has to be provided during deployment; the image exposes
the respective volumes to do so.

`docker run -d --name my-running-unbound
  --mount type=bind,source=$PWD/config,destination=/etc/unbound/conf.d
  --env ENABLE_CATCH_ALL=yes
  unbound:latest`

the directory **$PWD/config** must exist on the host and is
expected to contain unbound configuration. its content is
included in the toplevel hierarchy of the unbound main config.
(i.e.: server related settings must be parented under a
*server* section)

the *examples/* directory contains a simple deployment setup
using docker-compose.

## custom image configuration

it is possible to embed your Unbound configuration
(**/etc/unbound/unbound.conf**) in a  custom image.

Here is an example Dockerfile to achieve this:

```Dockerfile
FROM unbound:latest
COPY unbound.conf /etc/unbound/unbound.conf
```

## volumes

the container exposes several volumes:

* */etc/unbound/aux*

this directory hosts the ICANN certificate bundle as well
as the root zone hints.

* */etc/unbound/ssl*

this directory contains the SSL certificates and keys
for TLS communication for both the DNS resolver as well
as the remote control interface.

* */etc/unbound/conf.d*

files with the *.conf* file extension are included in
the unbound configuration.

* */etc/unbound/remote-conf.d*

files with the *.conf* file extension are included in
the unbound configuration under the **remote-control** clause.

* */etc/unbound/server-conf.d*

files with the *.conf* file extension are included in
the unbound configuration under the **server** clause.

## environment variables

environment variables can be used to control the behaviour of
some commonly tweaked settings without the need to mount a
configuration volume.

### catch-all forwarder

if the environment variable *ENABLE_CATCH_ALL* is defined,
a forward zone for all unhandled queries is created. without
further instructions, the nameservers **8.8.8.8** and
**8.8.4.4** are used. *UPSTREAM_PRIMARY* can be used to change
the first server, *UPSTREAM_SECONDARY* to change the second.

### preconfigured optimization

defining the environment variable *ENABLE_OPTIMIZATION* will
result in additional configuration settings with [optimization][]
values for large scale deployments.

some values can be changed with further variables:

* *MSG_CACHE_SIZE*

  defines the *msg-cache-size* value in megabytes. the
  *rrset-cache-size* value is calculated based on this values
  and is twice the size. the default values are 50m (and 100m respective)

* *CACHE_SLABS*

  size values for the following unbound settings:

  *msg-cache-slabs*, *rrset-cache-slabs*,
  *infra-cache-slabs*, *key-cache-slabs*

  the default values are the number of processors available to the
  docker container.

* *SO_RCVBUF*

  size in megabytes for the receive buffer *so-rcvbuf*

  the default value is 4m

* *SO_SNDBUF*

  size in megabytes for the send buffer *so-sndbuf*

  the default value is 4m

### auxiliary files

root zone hints, trust anchors and control SSL certificates,
are created automatically upon startup unless disabled:

* *DISABLE_CABUNDLE_CREATION*

  the existence of this environment variable prevents the
  creation of the ICANN root update certificate file
  /etc/unbound/aux/icannbundle.pem

* *DISABLE_HINTS_CREATION*

  if set, the root hints file (/etc/unbound/aux/root.hints)
  will not be created/updated

* *DISABLE_ANCHOR_CREATION*

  if set, the DNS root zone anchors (/etc/unbound/aux/root.key)
  will not be created/updated

* *DISABLE_CONTROL_SETUP*

  defining this environment variable will prevent the SSL
  keys and certificates for `unbound-control` from being created.
  those files reside in /etc/unbound/ssl and are used by the
  container healthcheck.

* *LAZY_CONTROL_SETUP*

  in combination with *DISABLE_CONTROL_SETUP*, this environment
  variable controls the behaviour, should the certificates
  already exist. if the variable is defined, the certificates
  will only be generated if not already present, otherwise they
  will be created with every container start.
